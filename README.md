This project contains code for data visualisation of simulation output from the University of Exeter Stand Alone model of Proxima Centauri b. The SA model is based on the Met Office Unified Model numerical climate simulation software.

The aim of the project is to explore the water cycle and its impact on spectral water features on a tidally locked exoplanet.
